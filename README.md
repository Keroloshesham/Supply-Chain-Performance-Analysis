# Supply-Chain-Performance-Analysis
This project analyzes supply chain performance across sales, logistics, manufacturing, and quality using an interactive Power BI dashboard.

# Project Overview
This project analyzes and visualizes end-to-end supply chain data to provide a comprehensive view of operational performance.
 The dashboard highlights key trends, supplier and product performance, logistics efficiency, and quality indicators to support data-driven operational and strategic decision-making.

The dashboard provides insights across:
* Total revenue and units sold analysis
* Lead time and logistics performance (shipping time and cost)
* Supplier and production performance
* Manufacturing cost and defect rate trends
* Key operational KPIs for quick performance assessment

# Project Objectives
* Analyze overall supply chain performance using key operational KPIs
* Evaluate revenue contribution by product type
* Assess logistics efficiency in terms of shipping time and cost
* Compare supplier performance based on lead time, production volume, and manufacturing cost
* Identify inefficiencies and optimization opportunities across the supply chain

# Dataset Description
The dataset represents a simulated multi-product supply chain environment and includes:

* Product details (Skincare, Haircare, Cosmetics)
* Sales and revenue data
* Supplier information and production volumes
* Logistics data (shipping cost, shipping time, transportation modes)
* Manufacturing cost and defect rate metrics

The dataset enables performance comparisons across products, suppliers, and logistics operations.

# Tools
* Power BI Desktop
* Power Query (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
* DAX (KPI Calculations and Measures)
* Excel (Data Preparation)
* GitHub (Project Hosting)

# Insights
* Total revenue reached $577.6K with 46K units sold, indicating stable demand
* Skincare products generate the highest revenue, yet inventory distribution is nearly equal across all product types
* Average lead time is 17 days, with noticeable variation among suppliers
* Total logistics cost amounts to $52.9K, highlighting cost optimization opportunities
* Manufacturing costs vary by supplier, while defect rates remain consistently low at around 2%

# Data Storytelling Framework
* Sales and operational data show strong overall performance with stable quality levels.
* However, deeper analysis reveals a mismatch between revenue contribution and inventory allocation, particularly for high-performing products.
* Additionally, logistics and supplier-level variations introduce hidden inefficiencies that impact lead time and cost.

By aligning inventory strategy, supplier selection, and logistics decisions with actual performance metrics, the supply chain can achieve higher efficiency, lower costs, and improved responsiveness to demand.

# Recommendations
* Reallocate inventory based on product revenue contribution rather than equal distribution.
* Optimize logistics routes and transportation modes to reduce shipping costs without increasing lead time.
* Prioritize suppliers with lower manufacturing costs and comparable defect rates.
* Use the dashboard as a continuous monitoring tool to identify inefficiencies early.

# Conclusion
* This supply chain dashboard demonstrates how data analytics can uncover operational inefficiencies beyond surface-level performance metrics.
* By leveraging data-driven insights, organizations can optimize cost structures, improve product availability, and enhance overall supply chain resilience.
* The project highlights the value of Power BI as a decision-support tool for supply chain and operations analytics.
